# Pokedex

Pokedex is a client for the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
Created in adaptive design to load and display a list of Pokemons.
By default, you could see 12 Pokemon Cards.
With a click of the "Load More" button, another chunk of the list is loaded and displayed on the page.
Pokemon details are displayed after clicking on the Pokemon Card.
